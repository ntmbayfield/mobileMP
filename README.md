About Magnetic Poetry 2.0:
This is a digital version of the once popular Magnetic Poetry Kit, which included a collection of over 300 magnets to go on your refrigerator door and could be arranged and re-arranged to form poems.   For now, users have the option of selecting from either the Original Word Kit or a Galvanize Word Kit.  The Galvanize Word Kit contains more than 541 words related to coding or to the Galvanize community, such as “the Gulls”, “embrace confusion”, “tehama” , “javascript” and “interface.”   A random selection of 30 magnets featuring words from the Galvanize set is generated when the app initially loads.  In the laptop version, you can move a magnet by clicking on it and holding the mouse down until you drag it into the desired location.  In the mobile version, you simply touch the magnet you want to reposition and drag it into whatever position you desire.  Users have the option to clear any of the previously generated sets of magnets by clicking on the reset button.  New magnet sets can be made using either the fun or the standard font, and in quantities of 30 or 60 magnets when using the desktop site or in quantities of 15 or 30 magnets when using the mobile version. I’ve also created an “Add Magnet” button which creates a magnet containing whatever text the user has typed into the pop-up window and adds it to the current set.



Upcoming Features Include:
-ability to pick from several different refrigerator door images to use as a backdrop


-option to register/create an account
-add more word sets and fonts that only registered members have access to
-ability to save a poem (takes a screenshot of users device and creates a jpeg file of the image) and share on social media sites
-site counter
-poem gallery, which would feature poems created using the app and posted by their author’s for the public to peruse
-random poem generator
-ability to generate custom image magnets, a parent for example could upload a picture of their child’s artwork to the app which would generate a magnet containing that image which they could then decorate their refrigerator door with

What Inspired Me:
-the fact that the original magnets won’t stick to most stainless steel refrigerators
-wanting a way to indulge my love for poetry during my morning commute on bart
-several poorly done implementations of this idea 

  


Possible options for monetizing this app include:
-selling it to McDonaugh Brothers, the company that manufactures and sells the Original Magnetic Poetry Kits
-licensing it for use to gaming or educational websites with similar applications that only work if the user has a Flash plug-in installed on their device
-making it available through the Google Play store for android users and through the App Store for Apple devices.
